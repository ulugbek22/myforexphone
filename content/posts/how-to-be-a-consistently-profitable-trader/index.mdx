There are so many advantages of being a trader and of course this requires so much hard work and time. Professional traders make pretty good income and trading has a lot of opportunities that other businesses don't. Now, let's take a look at those opportunities one by one.

## 1. You don't have to compete with anybody

I mean, theoretically, you do have your competitors, your losses are their gains and your gains are their losses. But, in reality, you don't know or see them and everything happens automatically. All you need to do is to control yourself and stick to the plan. Price goes up and down whatever happens. If you learn to enter the market on time you will make money no matter what your competitors do. Do not think about how many new people start training every day. They almost do not affect the market that much. Because they do not move the markets, big players, market makers, central banks do. I assume you are a regular person and if so you can completely forget about competitors and making money from someone else's loss.

You need to think about so many things in other businesses. Competition is the number one priority and you can not ignore this fact. You have to work more than your competitors just to outperform a little. Otherwise, your income decreases gradually or completely. In some cases, no matter how good you are than others, your some big competitors or government or anything that I haven't mentioned yet could kick you out of the game. assume there are so many businesses in the world that get out of game for any number of reasons.

## 2. Learning in a short period of time

The time that takes to learn trading is way shorter compared to any other businesses. If you start learning in a right way with the right mentality you can be a profitable trader and it doesn't take long.

You need to spend about 20 years of your life and tons of money just to be a doctor that makes average amount of money. After you learn 24/7 and graduate you will start working 24/7. When it comes to trading, you can learn it and be a profitable trader in two years. And then you can start increasing your little account and make money.

## 3. Learning for free

You can learn trading completely for free and be a profitable trader. You just need to spend some time and energy to do that. After learning trading you can start with a relatively small account. Trade until you double your account and withdraw initial investment money. And then you will be completely risk free. You can then continue trading and make money with no risk. Required capital for starting trading is mind-blowingly low. You can start training with almost nothing compared to other businesses. Just ask your friends how much money and time they spent to be a teacher and start making money.

People spend too much time and money just to learn something. And then they continue spending to start a business. For example, I can only imagine how much money it would take just to START a restaurant in city. I am not saying to make money, I said to start a restaurant. If you finally could open a restaurant, nobody can ever guarantee that it will cover all the money you spent. Sometimes, it takes too long to start a business and a lot of people give up along the way.

## 4. Expanding ability

Let's say you spent a lot of time and money and finally you start your business. You have a lot of competitors. And now developing your business or even just keeping it alive will be an endless marathon.

Let's say, you successfully started your business and it's working normally. But your income is limited depending on the size of your business. Or it's impossible to double your income without spending too much energy/time/money. A restaurant for 50 people can't make more money than it's limit no matter how many customers you have. To get over that limit you have two options: you have to rent a bigger place or expand your own, both of which requires a lot. And until that, most likely, you will lose your income.

In trading, you can start with relatively small and after you increased your account then you will be able to increase trading volume easily. You can make more money every month without spending anything. And you don't even have to rent or move to another place. Your business will be in your phone or laptop.

## 5. Controlling risk

In trading your risk could be controlled easily. It's literally impossible to lose more than what you have in your account. That's why you can start easily with even very small amount. The risk on every trade could be controlled. You can also stop trading anytime you want. Even if you can't (for a number of reasons) it's impossible to lose more money than what you have in your account. That means you control your risk completely.

Everything will be under your control.

What about other businesses? You can not start even a small caffee with a couple of thousands of dollars. It requires a lot to start a traditional business. You have to pay for the rent in advance. Even though it's unknown when this business starts generating profit, you still have to pay lots of fees. If you don't succeed and go bankrupt you still have to pay for everything. For gas, electricity, rent, workers' salary and so many more.

What if you risk that much and your business doesn't work?

## 6. Trading requires less time

After you learn how to tread then you can make money spending 30 minutes or 1 hour in a day or even in a month. Some people can spend a lot of hours at the computer to trade. But I don't care about them. I think there are better ways. And I have never seen a consistently profitable scalper.

If you want to make more money in trading then you don't have to spend more time at the computer. $10 000 or $100 000 trades are done exactly the same with one click. You can increase your $5000 account to $100 000 and then to $1 000 000. It doesn't take more time. You will be experienced gradually over time and start to spend less time.

Trading isn't like other businesses.

For example, let's say a driver spends 8 hours to make $50 000 a year. If he wants to make $100 000 he needs to spend 16 hours. This is not the case in trading.

## 7. Freedom

If you become a trader you will be your own boss. Even though it sounds simple, in fact this is a great thing. Just watch "Horrible bosses". You can have a day off, week off or even month off. I know some traders only trade 6 months in a year. You just can't do that in most of the jobs.

## 8. Working from anywhere

Trading is one of the most comfortable businesses on the planet if you do it right. You can trade from anywhere. All you need is a smartphone and the internet. Your, let's say a million dollar business is portable, sitting in your phone in your pocket.
